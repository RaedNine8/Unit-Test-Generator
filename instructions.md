So i'm trying to rebuild the qodo ai cover agent with a custom twist,
WHAT I WANT is to make it simpler, no reports , no html reports or xml , 
and no need for support for languages other than javascript and python, 
and the last thing i want is to make the AI caller only support opensource models through OLLAMA, 
i don't want it to leverage both Ollama AND OPENAI paid models,
ALSO REPLACE SQLITE WITH POSTGRESQL,
here's my postgresql credentials:
database_hostname = localhost
database_port = 5432
database_username = postgres
database_password = root
database_name = 
i don't have a database_name yet so use whatever
i ALREADY STARTED MAKING SOME SMALL CHANGES but i'm far from done or near done,
ACT ACCORDINGLY TO FINISH AND UPDATE THE PROJECT AS I INSTRUCTED YOU SO,
TAKE THE NECESSARY ACTIONS
FINAL NOTE: i don't have a virtual enviroment so create one if necessary:
and its name needs to be venv if possible
Generate and UPDATE  in order for me to achieve that, what should be deleted, updated and added. THINK DEEPLY BEFORE YOU TAKE ACTION, DONT TAKE ACTION wihtout thinking and parsing the whole context of the project
